# Risk!

1. Drain your battery faster than before ( of course, because its gaming module )
2. Overheat, make sure to use cooler
3. 1.4QP is the version of the script and its unstable/test project so maybe the setprop command somehow can be permanent, next update i will fix that problem.

# Recommend Shell app
LADB
Termux with Shizuku

i don't recommend brevent because brevent cannot handle large output of the script.
